WE ARE USING FIRST HEURISTIC : NUMBER OF PISPLACED TILES

PROGRAM GENERATES GRAPH AUTOMATICALLY : WE HAVE USED BOOTSTRAP-LIKE JAVA CLASS FOR DRAWING A GRAPH

SINCE 30 RANDOM PUZZLES GENERATES DIFFERENTLY AT EACH RUN GRAPH ITSELF IS CHANGING THEREFORE IT WILL SHOW DIFFERENT VALUES AT EACH RUN

SINCE PUZZLE ARE RANDOM SOMETIMES IT MAY GIVE VERY EASY PUZZLES OR VERY HARD PUZZLES THAT CAUSES PROGRAM TO LOOP >> PLEASE RUN SEVERAL TIMES

WE ARE ALWAYS TRACING THE FIRST 2 OF 30
